# Low-Sugar
A chrome Extension that identifies items on saveonfoods.com with less than 3g of sugar. I developed this Chrome extension to help my grandma who is prediabetic and struggles using technology clearly identify items from her local grocery store that will fit her diet

The extension works on any item posted with a nutrition label using a fetch request. It will then highlight the item green for easy identification.
